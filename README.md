##Movements
The components of the transformer's body are mapped to keys. Pressing one of these keys will activate the corresponding component.
Here are the key mappings (More to be added):

* `SPACE`: Camera
* `Z`: Waist
* `G`: Right Shoulder

To move the active component, the following key mappings work:
* `Q`: Increase X
* `A`: Decrease X
* `W`: Increase Y
* `S`: Decrease Y
* `E`: Increase Z
* `D`: Decrease Z
